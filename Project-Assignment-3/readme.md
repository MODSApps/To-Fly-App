<b>NOTE:

The "apk" folder needs to be copied to the directory: 'ToFly 072415 Final(2)\app\build\outputs'
The "resources" folder needs to be copied to the directory: 'ToFly 072415 Final(2)\app\build\intermediates'

The two folders were uploaded separately since they took too much space in the entire project folder and caused it to fail to sync.</b>
